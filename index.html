<p class="ulillo-processing-letras-iniciales" >Legal Rules Applicable to Gift Cards and Other Prepaid Card Programs This notice provides only general

information and should not be construed as legal advice. Merchants are encouraged to consult with 
their legal counsel for specific advice and to ensure compliance under the rules. On July 29, 2011, the 
U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued new anti-
money laundering rules to prevent the use of prepaid products (including gift cards) for money-
laundering.

All merchants who issue their own gift cards (either directly or through a third-party vendor) and merchants who sell or reload other company’s gift cards are impacted by the rules. 

What obligations apply? The most significant obligations under the rule are applicable to “providers of prepaid access” and “sellers of prepaid access” (as those terms are defined in the rules). 

However, certain obligations apply to all gift card issuers wishing to avoid falling within the definition of a “provider” or “seller” under the rule. (See below for the respective obligations of “providers” and “sellers” under the rules.) 

Who is a “provider” under the rules? A “provider” is a person who exercises principal oversight 
and control over a covered “prepaid program.” 

These terms are defined broadly and would generally include any merchant issuing gift cards, unless the merchant’s gift card program falls within an exemption to the rule. 2.

Your obligations under these rules will depend upon, among other things: a) The amount of gift cards sold to any one person b) 

The amount of value that can be “associated” with any one card during a one day period c) Whether you allow gift cards to be redeemed for cash d) 

Whether your gift cards are deemed “closed loop” cards FinCEN has announced that it will begin 

enforcing these rules after March 31, 2012, so all gift card merchants will need to take action to comply 

by that date. NEWS FLASH The primary exemption from this definition would apply only if a merchant’s 

card program meets all three of the following requirements: a) All of the gift cards are “closed loop” 

(defined as gift cards that can be used only for goods or services involving a defined merchant or 

location or set of affiliated locations, such as a specific merchant or merchant chain, or a college 

campus); b) No card can have more than $2,000 maximum value “associated” with it on any day, 

meaning the card’s balance at the beginning of the day plus any loads made that day (regardless of 

whether any funds are spent) cannot exceed $2,000 c) Cards cannot be redeemed, in whole or in part, 

for cash (beyond any specific dollar amount that might be required by state law). Unless the foregoing 

exemption or another exemption applies, a gift card issuer will generally be treated as a “provider” 

under the rules, and will be subject to the obligations described below. Who is a “seller” under the 

rules? There are two ways a gift card merchant can be a “seller” under the rules. First, a gift card 

merchant is a “seller” if it: a) Sells any type(s) of prepaid cards (even phone cards or closed loop gift 

cards under $2,000) having a combined value of more than $10,000 to any one person during any one 

day b) Has not implemented policies and procedures reasonably adapted to prevent such sales 

However, there is an exception for business-to-business bulk sales. A merchant is not a “seller” if it is 

only selling cards in excess of $10,000 in a day to another business for further distribution or sale to end 

users/consumers by that business. Second, if a merchant sells a prepaid card that does not fall within 

the exemption for “closed loop cards” having less than $2,000 maximum associated value in a day (and 

that cannot be redeemed for cash), and such cards can be used before personal information about the 

purchaser is collected by the merchant and verified in accordance with the rules, the merchant is a 

“seller” (in addition to likely being a “provider”). What must a merchant do if it is a “provider” or a 

“seller”? Merchants that are “providers” or “sellers” under the rules must: a) Develop, implement and 

maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program. b) Collect and retain identifying information 

about a person who purchases or reloads a prepaid card (including name, address, date of birth, and 

identification number), and verify that person’s identity. NEWS FLASH e) “Providers” must also register 

as an MSB with FinCEN and retain access to certain records related to prepaid access transaction 

(including detailed transactional information). f) “Sellers” must also collect and retain identifying 

information about a person who obtains any type(s) of prepaid access having a combined value in excess 

of $10,000 in a day (including name, address, date of birth, and identification number), and verify that 

person’s identity. How can a merchant avoid being a “provider” or a “seller”? First, for its own gift cards, 

the merchant must ensure that its gift cards are truly “closed loop,” that not more than $2,000 

maximum value can be associated with the card on any day, as described above, and that cards cannot 

be redeemed for cash (except as specifically required by law). Second, where a merchant sells or reloads 

other companies’ gift cards and open loop prepaid cards, the merchant must not sell or reload cards 

under any covered “prepaid programs” that can be used before customer identification and verification 

are performed. Check with the cards’ issuers to confirm. Third, the merchant must not sell any prepaid 

cards having a combined value in excess of $10,000 to any single person during any one day. The 

merchant must also implement policies and procedures reasonably adapted to prevent such sales. 

These policies and procedures must be risk-based and appropriate to the merchant, taking into account 

facts such as its typical customers, its location(s), and its volume of prepaid access sales.

<p class="about-des" > <h3>Alternative Payment Solutions</h3> </p>
<p class="ulillo-processing-letras-iniciales" > Earn Revenues Even Without Credit Card Processing PreWayPay is aware of the fact that the given credit card penetration for countries outside of north America is not as well established. Especially international customers prefer different means of payment besides credit card payments, such as Euro Direct Debit and Direct Pay solutions. Today’s marketplace has evolved to a global economy and factors such as multi-currency processing along with the integration of alternative payment solutions have become crucial to stay competitive. PreWayPay took measure and added several alternative payment solutions to its payment processing portfolio in order to meet this growing demand. The following listing provides a brief overview about the available alternative payment methods that you can add to your billing solutions: European Direct Debit It’s not a well-kept secret that the majority of the European citizens prefer other payment methods rather than online credit card payments. This notion is due to the low credit card penetration throughout European countries as well as different preferences in payment. The most common and accepted payment solution within the European market place is Euro Direct Debit. This billing solution is similar to U.S. ACH or Check21 payments but provides for recurring billing capabilities. Direct Debit is the most widely used form of payment other than cash for most European countries. By using our billing solution you are able to bill the following countries: Germany (DE) Austria (AT) The Netherlands (NL) United Kingdom (EN-UK) Spain (ES) Euro Direct Debit is the perfect addition to credit card billing. Leave it up to your customers to select the payment method of personal preference. Furthermore, you are able to bill clients which bear a general interest in your products and services but are lacking a credit card. </p>
<div class="sepreater"></div>
<br>
 <p class="ulillo-processing-letras-iniciales2" > ACH / CHECK21 
<br>
<p class="ulillo-processing-letras-iniciales" >ACH and Check21 are electronic networks for financial transactions within north-America. These two alternative payment solutions are the perfect addition for domestic credit card processing. An integration of these payment solutions will reduce the overall cost of check and credit card transmissions by lowering the amount of NSF’s/declines and chargeback’s, while enabling merchants to receive funding faster.
Here is a summary of the main advantages:</p>

<br>
 <p class="ulillo-processing-letras-iniciales" > - 1 Same day fund availability</p>
